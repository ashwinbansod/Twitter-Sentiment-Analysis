<e>mitt </e>looks very presidential to me when I mute the tv, close my left eye and look at him with only 47% of my right eye open!

 Watching the <a>debate</a> with the hubby, and i must say that <e>Romney</e> is very disrespectful. smh.
 Still irked. Response to a question about equality for <a>women</a> in the workplace, <e>Romney</e> was proud he let a woman go home early to make dinner.
 I dislike <e>Romney</e>. A lot.
 I still believe Obama did bad the 1st <a>debate</a> purposely... To have better knowledge & feeling on <e>Romney</e>. Ã¢Å“Å 
 <e>Romney</e> for sure would have fought AGAINST us during the <a>women's right movement</a>. And oh God the civil rights movement?? #Obama2012
 2nd reason , Mitt <e>Romney</e> family owned <a>slaves</a> . 3rd he hasn't fully given a direct legit plan on how he would make changes.

 But during his political career, <e>Romney</e> has flip-flopped on whether he actually wanted to serve in <a>Vietnam</a>.

 @markdewes But markets are global and the companies that <e>Romney</e> is fighting for support <a>China's</a> actions through their actions.
 If Ann #<e>Romney</e> can't get Mitt to respect <a>women</a> and their reproductive rights he is indeed a lost cause.
 @speechboy71 Exactly. It could be <e>Romney</e>'s worst <a>debate</a> at the worst possible time
 I don't trust Mitt <e>Romney</e> tho. I genuinely feel he doesn't care a bit for anyone who isn't well-off enough to help further his own interests
 I feel that Mittens <e>Romney</e> is not only a liar, but he is very rude. i was appalled that he specifically told the moderator "no"
 "I hired a woman once." -- Mitt <e>Romney</e>, Paragon of <a>Feminism</a> and equality.
 Why is everybody like "<e>Romney</e> better not be president!" i mean he is obviously not gunna win... -_-
 @edshow <e>Romney</e>'s disrespect to Candy shows how he bullies <a>women</a>

 Tonight's description of <e>Romney</e>- Snooty, elite, disrespectful, entitled, cheesy, wrong, insincere, distant, aloof, exposed and dishonest.
 @joshtpm Candy did great too many times <e>Romney</e> get's away with lying to the nation about time he was called out with un-disputable evidence
 I'll be honest, the only tidbit I've learned about either candidate is that <e>Romney</e> is a huge fan of The Killers. Now that's interesting.
 "Very little of what governor <e>Romney</e> just said is true" #themeofthe<a>debate</a>

 Mitt <e>Romney</e> was born <a>rich</a>, I can't vote for a nigga that never ate ramen noodles. >.<
 My 17 year old son was <a>fact</a> checking Mitt <e>Romney</e> during the debate last night. Mitt definitely kept him busy.
 My great objection to #<e>Romney</e> is his mistake belief that <a>insurance</a> is the only way to fund health care & we must be forced to buy insurance.
 Not only that. But Mitt <e>Romney</e> is comfortable with <a>disrespecting the president</a>. The president is still the president.
 One thing is clear, Mitt <e>Romney</e> prefers <a>binders full of women</a> more than binders full of facts.
 The truth finally comes out on <e>Romney</e>'s  <a>lies</a>#2012Debate
 There is also a videotape of <e>Romney</e> saying how he plans to do nothing and by doing that the <a>economy</a> will better itself.   What an idiot.
 Voting for <e>Romney</e> as a female student shows your true ignorance to what's going on.
 Really, the only things I don't like about <e>Romney</e> is his <a>view on gay rights and Planned Parenthood</>.
 <e>Romney</e> was petulant and characteristically misleading -   John Kerry on @Morningjoe
 @joetumbarello @jo_epp <e>Romney</e> doesn't want to <a>help the middle class</a> he's a rich scumbag who wants to help the upper class
 Of course <e>Romney</e> had <a>a binder full of women</a>. He's a Mormon.
 Mitt <e>Romney</e> has a HIT ME <a>face</a> and that stupid <a>smirk</a> of his, doesn't help
 I bet <e>Romney</e> has: "<a>Binders</a> of Blacks,"<a>Binders</a> of Hispanics," and "<a>Binders</a> of Gays."
 @markknoller <e>Romney</e> was too aggressive - disrespectful and basically a jerk.  A million miles from presidential.
 @cnnbrk: #CNNpoll: Governer <e>Romney</e> was kinda Rude!
 @rupertmurdoch I'm getting the impression that you like Mr <e>Romney</e>. That would make you a very silly person.
 you think Mitt <e>Romney</e> checks his <a>mentions</a>?
 FACT: There were NO <a>women partners at Bain Capital</a> during <e>Romney</e>'s time #bindersfullofwomen #Phoney #MorningJoe
 On a political note, after the <a>debate</a>, would people still root for <e>Romney</e>? I sure hope not.
 Mitt <e>Romney</e> makes me mad, when he was talking about <a>jobs</a>, but never explained how! Its like he's saying: "I will get you all a job" . . df.
 @DRUDGE_REPORT  Mitt <e>Romney</e> is a relentless, bald-faced <a>liar</a>, a sociopath, a thing without a conscious: the devil.
 "Gov. <e>Romney</e> doesn't have a 5-point <a>plan</a>. He has a 1-point plan... to make sure that folks at the top play by a different set of rules."
 Mitt <e>Romney</e> is nothing more than <a>a snake oil salesman</a> peddling his bullshit to a Fox bubble head mentality!
 Ready for the election to be over. I don't need anymore time to come to the conclusion that <e>Romney</e> is ridiculous.
 Only reason i'd support #<e>Romney</e> is because we both got <a>binders</a> full of bitches. Hahahaha. #notreally
 - Mitt <e>Romney</e>'s campaign is $25 million in debt. This is the guy that's gonna fix our <a>economy</a>?
 @nahjaaa dead ass <e>Romney</e> going to be <a>the end of America</a>
 <e>Romney</e>, if elected, will single-handedly create more <a>enemies</a> for the U.S. than BOTH presidents named Bush.
 Heres the thing about <e>Romney</e>: everything he said about <a>women</a> that we're all laughing about, he says those things because he has nothing else
 "@FlawlessDelena: Ladies. <e>Romney</e> hates trees and women. Ian Somerhalder."
 How can people even consider Voting for a <a>LIAR</a> like <e>Romney</e>? I'm not even sure he knows the difference anymore #questions #OTVB
 <e>Romney</e> has my vote if he would make <a>#bindersfullofwomen</a> jokes through the day today on twitter himself. Lets laugh so we don't cry
 Mitt <e>Romney</e>'s <a>behaviour in discussion</a> is horrible :(
 I woke up to so many <e>Romney</e> <a>jokes from last nights debate</a>. Lets leave this rich fortunate blessed white man alone.

 <e>Romney</e>'s <a>Tax plan</a> still sounds like magic.
 "@devontemckee:Craziest thing ever on the web, if you google image <a>"completely wrong"</a> tons of pictures of <e>Romney</e> show up"Gives me #thecreeps
 I will personally go canvassing for him door to door if <e>Romney</e> spends his entire first two minutes of the next #debates doing Gangnam Style
 Told my mother I was voting for <e>Romney</e> so that she'll be able to come home from work and cook dinner for me
 THAT was the <e>Romney</e> we all have come to know and (for some) loathe.
 @MarkHalperin Nothing brilliant about <e>Romney</e> last night  #bindersfullofwomen
 After watching the debate I can honestly say that Mitt <e>Romney</e> is a fucking idiot.
 @JansingCo <e>Romney</e> IS rude AND a bully.I thought he was going2jump on Candy.No comparison&yes I am a <a>woman</a>&he deeply offends me
 Mitt <e>Romney</e> is an actual joke, he <a>contradicts himself</a> every debate
 @MattBatzel <e>Romney</e> got schooled last night!  <e>Romney</e> was so disrespectful.  Loved when Crowley called Mitt out on one of his MANY <a>lies</a>
 @TheFix I feel the same way about <e>Romney</e> <a>lies</a>, but after all we are talking about the media doing their jobs. #AintGonnaHappen
 @scottRcrawford @guardian Sorry, but any man who calls himself a <a>feminist</a> deserves ridicule. <e>Romney</e>'s only moderately more ridiculous.
 If any <a>female</a> is voting for <e>Romney</e> you're an idiot... He's telling us we have no control over our body
 Mitt <e>Romney</e> is a misogynist and his 18th century views on <a>women</a> make me sick. Any woman voting for him is in denial or has no self respect.
 Mitt <e>Romney</e> has a "book filled with qualified <a>women</a>"... I think they call this a black book.  :)
 <e>Romney</e> told 31 "myths" in 41 minutes - in other words, he <a>lied</a> 31 times.
 <e>Romney</e> can't <a>pronounce</a> "legislation" and it annoys me.

 Wanna hear a <a>joke</a>? Mitt <e>Romney</e>.
 @thehill <e>Romney</e> has no clue <a>what we want</a>. He is #binderfullofemptypages #debate #MittLies
 @aravosis I think the <a>binders</a> comment reflects <e>Romney</e>'s arrogance & self-centeredness: if it was done, obviously he must have thought of it.
 So when I die, bury me next to 2 binders full of <a>women</a>.- Mitt "2 Chainz" <e>Romney</e>
 "what was Mitt <e>Romney</e>'s big <a>gaffe</a> last night?" showing up?
 I'm so jealous of <e>Romney</e>, he has binders of <a>woman</a>, and I have to settle for folders :(
 I wish someone had asked this last night: If the government cannot create <a>jobs</a>, why does <e>Romney</e> think he can create 12 million? #debate2012
 A much better dig on <e>Romney</e> would be to point out that his response to <a>equal pay</a> was the gender equivalent to "Hey, I have black friends"
 <e>Romney</e> do not know the <a>true meaning of "middle class", "poor", "struggle" etc</a>
 I think that <e>Romney</e> showed how he doesn't respect <a>normal (middle class) people</a> by just putting up his hand and talks about what he wants!
 It's national Ass day?... I think Mit <e>Romney</e> needs to get his <a>contexts</a> right.
 Reading highlights of the US presidential debate, it's apparent one should wear a helmet while reading <a>anything said</a> by <e>Romney</e>. #facepalm
 @FINALLEVEL When I watched <e>Romney</e> <a>talk</a> last night all I could hear in my head was @MrChuckD singing "He talking loud, ain't saying nothing"
 @DebtTrut no problem : ). I think we both r disgusted with <e>Romney</e>'s bominable <a>behavior</a>. He is one mean guy who feels entitled to NO RULES!
 Mr. #<e>Romney</e>, #<a>Mexicans / #Latinos</a> should not be referred to as #illegals. They are people with have #families just like you. #immigration
 Did <e>Romney</e> get those <a>Lady Binders</a> at Staples?
 Mitt <e>Romney</e> looks like one of the muppets.
 "Mitt <e>Romney</e>" needed to hire a recruiter to find the #<a>bindersfullofwomen</a> .Trapped In The Closet #gll GoDs Laughing Loudly
 @realDonaldTrump <e>Romney</e> is just like you,criticisms but no solutions.You both treat running a business as If you were <a>running a Country</a>.
 I'm rather angry about a lot of things this morning, and I can blame it squarely on Mitt <e>Romney</e> and Phil Ginsberg.
 #<e>Romney</e> confirmed the stereotype, while floundering to explain how he wants to <a>help women</a>.
 If <e>Romney</e> <a>goes into office</a> we might as well go back to being slaves in society.
 @sydbrownstone: 10 bucks says next year there will be a #cmj band playing @cakeshopnyc called <e>Romney</e>'s <a>Binder</a>.Â the next Sleater Kinney
 Monica: "If we took out all the oil from <e>Romney</e>'s hair last night the US could be <a>energy</a> independent." #Debate2012 #GObama
 Reporters: 'Phase' is only rarely used as a verb. <e>Romney</e> was not <a>phased by the questions</a> last night. He was 'fazed' = disconcerted.
 Mitt <e>Romney</e> is the Jame Gumb of politics: IT PUTS THE <a>WOMAN</a> IN THE BINDER, OR ELSE IT GETS THE NO EQUAL <a>PAY</a> HOSE.
 <e>Romney</e> seems like the kind of guy who still makes "<a>women</a> in the kitchen making sandwiches" jokes.
 <e>Romney</e> obviously doesn't even <a>watch the news</a>, even during an election, so he didn't know what the Pres said the day after Benghazi!
 <e>Romney</e> will magically become conservative and stop <a>supporting what he has</a> for decades if he wins. #LoL
 <e>Romney</e> is full of horse shit.
 @ladyblue49 I tweeted in the morning, and your night during debate using #Venuspeak if you read, I can prove <e>Romney</e> is weak in <a>Math</a> :-)

 #HistoricGhettoMoments #<e>Romney</e>'s<a>jobplan</a>: Employers make the rules and employees get screwed
 @MartinBashir Of course <e>Romney</e> looked for <a>women</a> to work for him. He could pay them less and keep his payroll down.
 <e>Romney</e> why you so damn dumb, I mean look at the <a>decisions</a> you want to make, We might as well jump our asses back to the 1800's ! -____-
 Mitt <e>Romney</e> disgusts me. He's so rude, and idiotic. I pray he isn't our future president.
 And on the other side please explain to me why <e>Romney</e> would be a good president. Because I don't see anything that appeals to me at all.
 What Planet  does Mitt <e>Romney</e> live on? Does He really think <a>cutting taxes for the wealthy</a> will create <a>Job growth</a>? is he a Mormon or a MORON?
 USA would be in serious trouble if we somehow voted <e>Romney</e> into office. He is so short sighted just like most americans
 Mum mentioned Mitt <e>Romney</e> earlier, I don't think I've hated someone has much as him, just knowing that he's breathing annoys me. #Angry
 @ElfandSlater Listen to the rose garden speech before you say <e>Romney</e> was corrected. He never called the <a>Benghazi attack</a> an act of terror.
 Look on the bright side, if <e>Romney</e> wins, maybe he'll start keeping his <a>money</a> in our banks.
 Let me get political here Mr.<e>Romney</e> u can't bring the #<a>fuel prices</a> down but your rich ass homies could
 The moderator had to interrupt <e>Romney</e> so much because he wouldn't <a>follow the format of the debate</a>.
 @Dominic_Calvano True! At least <e>Romney</e> kept the <a>lying</a> to a minimal, didn't top his 27 lie record in the first debate.
 If there's one thing I learned from Mitt <e>Romney</e>, it's that I need to store all my <a>women in binders</a>. Gotta tidy up around here.
 Maybe if Governor <e>Romney</e> watched more Sesame Street his <a>math</a> would be better.
 <e>Romney</e> looks like he <a>lies</a> to people to get more <a>money</a>
 Can't wait to hear #<e>Romney</e> stumble through the <a>foreign policy</a> part of the debate next Monday.
 That creepy <a>smirk</a> that <e>Romney</e>'s always got plastered on his face seriously creeps me out...

 Under <e>Romney</e>, Massachusetts was 47th in <a>job creation</a>.
 To be fair, <a>"Binders full of Women"</a> is a pretty weak gaffe to be harping on.  Plenty more substantive reasons not to vote for <e>Romney</e>.
 Remember: <e>Romney</e>'s Mormonism admonishes <a>women</a> only to work until she has children. Then quit work, stay home to raise them #p2 #tcot #ocra
 <e>Romney</e> is so good that he could sell shaving cream to the Taliban.
 Mitt <e>Romney</e> might <a>win</a> the erection and that scares me #foxnews
 <e>Romney</e> really needs to stop <a>mentioning birds and death together</a> in any way shape or form. It's not helping him.
 I'd just like to point out that <e>Romney</e> wears more <a>hairspray</a> than most girls
 <e>Romney</e> is a "PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE" NOT the PRESIDENT, & since all he does is <a>point fingers at the Current</a> he won't be the next

 @alexwagner <e>Romney</e> just said Government doesnt create jobs. Then how is he gonna <a>create jobs</a> as President?
 "Some campaigns are more focused on <a>attacking</a> a person than stating what they prescribe" REALLY <e>Romney</e>... you did that this entire debate!
 <e>Romney</e> has so many things to <a>brag about himself</a>. I wish he was more comfortable doing it.
 <e>Romney</e> brings up the 47% elephant in the room by talking about his <a>passion</a> for the 100% of Americans #debate

 Excuse <e>Romney</e>, he <a>talks</a> in the third person sometimes. #debate
 Now that <e>Romney</e>'s talking about what we don't have to <a>settle for</a>... do we still have to settle for a third round of this? #debate2012
 <e>Romney</e> really is a dumb ass. He doesn't even want to <a>listen to</a> the president which means he won't listen to the idiots who vote for him.
 #<e>Romney</e>: "I know what it takes to create jobs".  Really?  Then why did you kill so many by <a>bankrupting companies Bain purchased</a>?

 I just don't understand how <e>Romney</e>'s against <a>single parents</a> and also against <a>abortions</a>, especially for those who've been raped. #logic

 <e>Romney</e>'s definition of <a>workplace equity for women</a> was letting them go home early enough to cook dinner. What an awful answer!!
 @lovelyAirikahxX exactly. <e>Romney</e> would probably just <a>mess</a> it all up.
 What?! Now <e>Romney</e> wants <a>women to get home from work sooner</a> so they can make dinner? Boys can learn to cook too, ya know!
 For the record: I do not believe <e>Romney</e> could have stopped <a>the attacks in Libya</a> ... #vote
 I'd rather have Bush in the office than <e>Romney</e>
 @itsgabrielleu @Tyrese @johnlegend @aliciakeys  <e>Romney</e>'s Solution to <a>women's right</a> is to get women home earlier to cook dinner..

Obama get's a little aggressive and passionate and he's perceived as being angry but <e>Romney</e> is blatantly <a>rude</a> and it's nothing. OH.
@Lis_Smith I agree Mrs smith. <e>Romney</e> will guarantee his major <a>taxes</a> will not go up but for us regular Americans he had no clear answers.
God will lead us in the way we want. Not the President. So I would rather vote for a Christian in Obama than a <a>Mormon</a> in <e>Romney.</e>

<a>Stupid</a> <e>Romney</e> ugh only cares about money and power
This was a VERY testy debate. <e>Romney</e> played Biden card & interrupted frequently. Not sure it works when you're being <a>rude</a> to Pres though.
I love the fact checkers after the debate when they PROVE that all that shit <e>Romney</e> <a>talkin</a> is just that bull fuckin shit! No facts No plan
So happy that Pres Obama pointed out the irresponsible opportunistic act of <e>Romney's</e> <a>statements</a> on the Libyan attack prematurely #CSPAN2012
Honestly, how can anybody support <e>Romney?</e>  The guy is a <a>liar</a> and a tool.

Here we go <a>outsourcing</a>.<e>Obama</e> do you have no shame.
No sense<e>Obama</e> because <e>Obama</e> has <a>no idea to run a business</a>. Maybe if he had worked at McDonalds he would have a clue.
@seanhannity glad the Buck stopped with<e>Obama</e>. Unfortunately <e>Obama</e>'s playing golf, or on vacation.
FACT:<e>Obama</e> in rose garden didn't refer to <a>Benghazi</a> as <a>terrorist attack</a> or act of terror. But thanks 4 playing Crowley-"http://t.co/BGW5lD0J
@LisaYoungFC more <a>guns</a> have been bought since <e>Obama</e> is president. Lol
<e>Obama</e> just said <a>"when I was president"</a>. He<a> knows</a>. #heisouttahere
I just don't like the way <e>Obama</e> <a>talks</a>. #cocky
<e>Obama</e> needs to get outa here.
<e>Obama</e> claims <a>"low skill" jobs</a> belong overseasÃ¢â‚¬Â¦shows his real lack of concern as it regards having ALL Americans being able to<a> WORK</a>
@jaronjones That exchange was a complete embarrassment for <e>Obama</e>.  He had nothing to say in his defense.
<e>Obama</e> literally just said some jobs aren't coming back and that he doesn't want <a>low-skill jobs</a>. High-skilled industry can't <a>employ </a>everyone.
<a>Jobs</a> are not the answer? WOW mr <e>Obama</e>
#debates <e>Obama</e> believes our <a>tax </a>$ is his to give to his highest contributors!
<e>Obama</e>: <a>Self-reliance</a>, but you didn't build that.
Now <e>Obama</e> comes with the big lie.  He believes in <a>risk taking</a>,<a> self reliance</a>, etc?  Oh come on.  First time I've heard him say it.
What a <a>complete tool</a> <e>Obama</e> is.
Wow. <e>Obama</e>'s not even answering the question and its about HIM! #Debate
<e>Obama</e>.. <a>Checkmate</a>.
Given how many people think <e>Obama</e> is a communist/socialist, him saying that the <a> free market</a> is great IS countering a misconception.
<e> <e>Obama</e></e> just said he believes in <a>self-reliance</a>. That's 100% against all of his <a>policies</a>. He wants people to rely on the<a> government</a>.
@harryandximena <a>Are you kidding me</a> ! I hate <e>Obama</e> !!
@JamesTHarris Can't stand to hear <e>Obama</e>'s voice anymore. Lies lies lies!!!!
Yeah <e>Obama</e> never called it a terrorist attack in the rose garden. Called it an "attack" that's pretty broad Barack
Number one reason I hate <e>Obama</e>? Because <a>killing</a> a child should never be legal, even if you consider it just a 'group of cells'.
@DakodawithaD: Man. I'm amazed how much of a liar, fake and moron <e>Obama</e> is. He has really <a>outdone himself</a>. #debates  #<e>Romney</e>ftw
<e>Obama</e> did lie about the <a>Arizona immigration model</a> success reference though.

No acts of #terror will ever shake the <a>resolve of this nation</a>. The only time <e>Obama</e> he said the word terror in the #RoseGarden. About #Lybia
Sorry guys, four more years of <e>Obama</e> is going to go much like the last four. No where but down.
<e>Obama</e>: "I'm the president and I'm always responsible." Is that why you spent the past four years blaming Bush? #HofstraDebate #<e>Romney</e>2012
<e>Obama</e> functioned much <a>better</a> at sea level.
I dont give a damn what anyone says in 4 years all <e>Obama</e> has changed is the gas prices and not in a good way #N<e>Obama</e>2012

@alec_meyers he is a master of taking things out of context. Still don't see reason to give <e>Obama</e> his job back. He's had 4 yrs.
@AdamSerwer Yep, a <a>lose</a> for <e>Obama</e>!
@ChrisPatrick_3 ...and all <e>Obama</e> can say is that he promises to fix what he hasn't the last 4 years... He had an opportunity and failed

<e>Obama</e> got too much <a>confidence</a> Mitten
@KalebDaniel305 <e>Obama</e> can keep <a>talking</a> and you can KEEP listening but all I hear is rhetoric.

#Debates-helloooo, compare apples to apple's... <e>Obama</e> is comparing <a>capital gains income </a>to  <a>payroll income</a>, not the same <a>tax criteria</a>!
@ParkergirlUSA |  <e>Obama</e> dug deeper with the lie about the <a>Rose Garden statement</a> being a terrorist attack.
wish audience had asked <e>Obama</e> why he did not do all the things he continues to <a>pledge</a> to do if given 4 yrs
C'mon, @arifleischer. We both know #<e>Obama</e> didn't talk ab his plans because HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY. #debate #cnn
@xoxo_MonaeLove Again he helped FIX that<a> economy</a> after <e>Obama</e> let the entire Nations economy crash and led to all state economies crashing
#<e>Obama</e> went over time. The host said time was up. His reply "this is important" IT'S also important 2 follow the rules #presidentialdebate
<e>Obama</e> sure tries to make himself look better by lying.. He needs to try a lot harder.! #2012PresidentialDebate
@KatieeB_ people who think <e>Obama</e>'s <a>health care ideas </a>are a good thing need a nice slap across the back of the head........... With a shovel.
@andyeisenbacher We cannot keep going I. The direction we have been going... <e>Obama</e> and those before him!
Watched the <a>debate</a>, obviously. I find <e>Obama</e>'s energy policy laughable when earlier he said he planned to increase energy prices.
<e>Obama</e>, look bud, you cant make up lies about what someone just say two mins ago.. Recorded dumbass!
Why do people think things are gonna get better if <e>Obama</e> is re-elected? It will be the exact same as the last 4 years. I don't understand.
Read the transcript. RNC chair accuses <e>Obama</e> of lying about Libya and moderator "aided and abetted."
So why does <e>Obama</e> get props for bin laden, but doesn't get held responsible for <a>unemployment</a>, he inherited both, be fair I'm that
@neaboo89 the problems <e>Obama</e> didn't create
<e>Obama</e> has appeared weak and tired in several recent public forums. I wonder if he actually even wants to be president anymore...
<e>Obama</e> <a>talked</a> louder, but didn't tell us what he would differently than he is already doing. Talked a lot,but said nothing. An empty suit.
It's funny how these retired senators that are republicans are<a> endorsing</a> <e>Obama</e>
I only wish <e>Obama</e> would have shown this vigor during the last <a>debate</a>! #Debate2012
Political beliefs aside, <e>Obama</e> belatedly lied about Libya. There is no denying it. The man has ZERO character.
Emergency Blood Transfusion and fully covered health appointments and you want to convince me that I shouldn't vote for <e>Obama</e>!! #<e>Obama</e>2012
@christinaa_D well you have your opinions and i have mine. I think he will do better than what <e>Obama</e> has done in the past 4 years.
Why would you <a>vote </a><e>Obama</e>? He lied about the deaths of 4 Americans overseas over national tv!da fuck
Remember when <e>Obama</e> said 4 years ago that he was gonna cut <a>national debt</a> in half? That's funny because its almost doubled #idiot
#LNYHBT  Tired of listening to <e>Obama</e> be a stranger to the truth. His failure to answer the questions asked and standard rhetoric.
Its seriously impossible to double the <a>national debt</a> in four years. And it wasn't only 8 trillion in 2008. #NiceTryThough #<e>Obama</e>!
What can't be argued is that what <e>Obama</e> has done over the past four years hasn't worked. Plain and simple
@Hrothgar_KP the situation for young white college grads under <e>Obama</e> is only going to get worse...much worse...ive studied economics
If <e>Obama</e> thought Libya was an act of terror, why did he & his staff come out on numerous tv shows for 2 WEEKS citing a video was to blame?!!
Didn't even watch the <a>debate</a> because I can't stand listening to <e>Obama</e> make excuses for the hundreds of thousands of lazy Americans we have.
@TheLastWord @mitt<e>Romney</e> Exactly. <e>Obama</e> is an angry, spoiled child.
check out the 2012 <a>labor participation rate</a>...lowest in over 10 year by US Dept of Labors own numbers...Bad <e>Obama</e><a> policies</a> are to blame!
Moderator was way out of line helping <e>Obama</e> with the Libya lie!  OMG
@seanhannity Totally agree. <e>Obama</e> had nothing to bring to the <a>debate</a>.
I dont understand #<e>Obama</e> lies when there is <a>fact</a> check. We are going to find out the truth so why lie?
What has <e>Obama</e> done in the last four years to improve America! Nothing! He lost the <a>debate</a>!!!
Wow - this group didn't think <e>Obama</e> performed well at all. 'Just attacked' & had no ideas, didn't answer questions & was totally on defense.

 @Talkmaster If Romney had to describe how different he is from W, shouldn't <e>Obama</e> '12 have to show how he's different from the last 4 yrs?
 <e>Obama</e> is a criminal fraud, a usurper. If you notice, you are a "birther." It doesn't matter which crime you notice. #gop #tcot #p2 #dems
 Shake my Sheets! @andersoncooper Actually Admitted that " <e>#Obama</e> didn't <a>answer certain questions</a> in #Debate"
 Both <e>Romney and Obama</e> have really annoying speaking voices 
 The worlds gonna be one fucked up place if <e>Obama</e> takes presidency again #realtalk
 Based on what I heard <e>Obama</e> say last night, if he gets re-elected, I am tempted to give up-close my business and unemploy 230+ folks!
 @realDonaldTrump <e>Obama</e> was more of a boistrous bull spouting out the same old things that he DIDN'T achieve in 4 years and can't in 4 more.
 @PaulRyanVP Ask America why the press has never ask <e>Obama</e> the tough questions these last 4 years.
 @MeKaymi_Tensei He carried himself poorly in that <a>debate</a>, but I do think the shitty moderator gave <e>Obama</e> an advantage he didn't need.
 @uhlyssaoliviero - if <e>Obama</e> gets elected, guys like me will go out of business. People who pay the taxes that enable fin aid, will be gone
 I bet <e>Obama</e> was the kid in class who could smooth talk his teachers into postpone homework...but never actually turned it in
 <e>Obama</e> has connections with Al queda terrorist organization.
 @sallykohn why don't you say that to the families face. You are a loser. By the way, <e>Obama</e> lost the debate.
 @AdrianneCurry Would just rather not vote for a Socialist (<e>Obama</e>)
 @fantaztika @TheRealRoseanne @rebabrooks @ConsiderThis1 I love Roseanne, but taking <e>Obama's</e> votes is uncool as hell, this is not a joke.
 @wrocorn CNN proves again they are in the tank for a man who consistently lies to America.  CNN is not news, it's propaganda! <e>Obama</e> LIES!
 Here bit by bit the American people are standing up to Socialisim,Communisim,Marxist Muslims and <e>Obama</e> the Black Master of Black the people.
 @TheTimmyTebow  Try to find something good to say about somebody if u can but lv <e>Obama</e> alone. It's not flattering to u.
 I don't appreciate how <e>Obama</e> <a>capitalisizes</a> on the fact that he's black.
 @BillPhill12 Omg, that was the funniest thing ever - and every person struggling in <e>Obama's</e> <a>economy</a> wanted to say it, too.
 AllI can say about last night's debate is that <e>Obama</e> looked pretty desperate.
 The amount of <e>Obama</e> <a>impressions</a> I hear is sickening.
 But honestly, My opinion is neutral this year, and that's why I'm not even voting. Both <e>Mitt and Obama</e> are f'n shit up. Why bother... #meh
 Shit that was a low blow to <e>Obama</e> omg lol
 @bogealoge I don't have to I know what <e>Obama</e> <a>promised</a> hasn't come true
 <e>Obama administration</e> can't get even the simple aid to <a>Syrian rebels right</a>.  It is going to the Assad govt.
 I don't "hate" anyone... But I SERIOUSLY dislike <e>Obama</e>. The man irritates the hell out of me. <e>Romney</e> isn't much better. Reset button plz?! ï¿½Â˜ï¿½
 @TheValorieClark i don't like either one. I am more socially conservative. But <e>Obama</e> hasn't done enough good in his <a>first four years</a>.
 I'm going to put an <e>#Obama & #Romney</e> sticker on my car to confuse people. The good news is that I don't particularly like either of them...
 It's amazing looking at my twitter and Facebook feeds and seeing how republican my friends are. I was a miracle <e>Obama</e> even got in office.
 Someone had a sticker on they car that said defeat <e>Obama</e>. Everybody should get out they car to whoop they ass

 Y'all see this shit --->"@5hannnnnon: <e>Obama</e> shut up you nigger. You're a liar. Your brother lives in Kenya where you were born. #Romney2012"
 I've seen 3 Presidents look at and lie to the American people. Nixon, Clinton, now <e>Obama</e>. Obama's lie involved the death of four people.
 This quote is for everyone who voted for <e>Obama</e> in 2008. "Fool me once shame on you. Fool me twice shame on me." #Romney2012
 President <e>Obama</e> lied to the American population tonight. Dug a whole new hole for him on this Lybia thing. #Debates

 @AlexisClewis24 and like I said I dot care who president is.. But <e>Obama</e> sure as hell didnt do a good job fixing ANYTHING
 @AshleyOkinawa lld I didn't say anything to harm their party, <e>Romney</e> did that for himself.I just commented on <e>Obama</e>!
 @gaylortangg and <e>Obama</e> has strikingly similar ideologies to Jimmy Carter and Karl Marx, both of whom know nothing of successful nations.
 <e>Obama</e> did not answer the question on Libya. <e>Romney</e> missed the opportunity to demand an answer n the moderator didnt demand an answer either!
 "@coledixon15: <e>Obama</e> is a self centered jackass that needs to take his foreign ass back to his Muslim countries." @llcoollittle & this guy 2
 @RNCResearch Heck it wasn't the lies that are the problem, it was the lack of <a>ideas</a> from <e>Obama</e>, so another four years of the same.
 Listen <e>Obama</e>, Wallstreet and the big car companies you bailed out are in the same league. Quit blaming other people for your problems.
 I will admit, #Bush's spending was out of control. But <e>Obama's</e> <a>spending habits</a>... just completely unacceptable #NotFittoGovern #Debate2012
 @lindaph1 Hell <e>Obama</e> can't even take care of one border patrol agent how can he handle <e>diplomatic security</e>? BHO Admin. is a chinese cluster.
 Heard <e>Obama</e> used Biden's acting coach - who evidently specializes in LYING & goofy looking fake aggression with angry eyes!
 Only watched enough of the debate to form an intitial impression, basically <e>Obama</e> <a>walked</a> in like a pimp and ate that face.
 Michelle <e>#Obama</e> broke debate rules by cheering when moderator lied about #Libya to save Barack's butt. #MSMBias
 The <e>#Obama</e> legacy:  Bad Policies = Poor Results = Gloomy Future. Would you really rehire him to make sure this happens?#Romney
 I'm not racist but <e>Obama</e> needs to remember that a white man built this land. A black man sold his families to the white man.
 @AidanLicks but if you want government to have less power, <e>Obama</e> should be your biggest enemy
 <e>Mr. President</e> please stop the cover up. You did not call it a terrorist attack until 2 weeks after the attack. We have the transcript @Obama
 @jay33231 just listening to <e>Obama</e> <a>talk</a> and blatantly <a>lie</a> is enough to make me want to vomit over and over again
 Best thing about the debate? If <e>Obama</e> thinks he won the first, he'll have a similarly distorted impression of the second.
 Yes, <e>Barack Obama</e> LIED last night. On September 12 he was blaming a video, not terrorism, for Libya. LIED. #mapoli
 EVERY American knows lots of people who are out of work since <e>Obama</e> was elected. THAT will get him fired!
 If <e>Obama</e> wins this election because of women's issues...I lose faith in my gender. #prolife #smallgovernment #RomneyRyan12
 Obama26Obama Let's hope WHEN <e>Obama</e> is overturned, he ends up on welfare and food stamps. )
 Why is the media is claiming a win for <e>Obama</e>? Actually being awake this debate doesn't count. I like him even less, he acted like a jerk.
 <e>Obama</e> SHOULDN'T have to keep reassuring his base after last night. Please let him speak2&secure the independent& undecideds w/out criticism
 #debate If <e>Obama</e> had been telling the truth last night, he might have won.  America loses when a President lies to our face! #RomneyRyan
 For a man with 4 years on the job, pres <e>Obama</e> seems to be very uncertain and lacking of conviction.
 truth-<e>Obama</e> failed on emigration reform,but the republicans did to-they never gave any help even when they got what they wanted.
 <e>President Obama</e> is worth 12million and has money over in china
 <e>Obama</e> lied about <a>Libya and production of coal</a>.  Obama claimed he has signed more permits  for coal. Not true, People in WV are unemployed
 @whoisdemichael actually, when <e>Obama</e> was a senator, he proposed the bills & approved the plans that are responsible for our nation's debt.
 @Daggy1 <e>Obama</e> didn't. Went straight into education. High end jobs. Prob there is. High end = low volume. We got that now in Ireland.
 Don't live in America so it doesn't concern me but I want to see <e>Obama</e> lose just to see what Romney can do in 4 years
 <e>Obama</e> is gonna outsource low paying jobs (most of y'all) Create more High skilled jobs. (NONE of y'all)

 @KeithMcCullough @daytrend  IF <e>Obama</e> won, it was with the help of the moderator. I call that cheating.

 @gretawire People are realizing what a failure <e>Obama</e> has been.Hopefully more will smarten up!
 I find it very interesting that <e>Obama</e> criticizes Romney for having a large pension. I guess he thinks success is bad. That's the Obama way.
 Too many people on the Obama bandwagon solely because he's black.
 Hey <e>Obama</e>! you export <a>inflation</a> to the world you dick! #YouHaveNoBrain

 <e>obama</e> sucks. Didn't even watch the <a>debate</a>

What's funny is, I think Mr. <e>Romney</e> <a>did</a> better this debate. Raising your voice and saying Obamacare a lot in first debate was not a victory.

<e>Obama</e> be killin' this <a>economy!</a> #RANTTWEET #cantstandhim
Even though I'm biased, I'm calling this for Romney, but just barely.  Fact checks will show <e>Obama</e> a <a>liar.</a> #tcot #RomneyRyan2012 #debate
Obama <e>needed</e> the moderator to <a>bail</a> him out and also called a man named Kerry "Kerr". lol
@ConservativeBro I think Romney won,because <e>Obama</e> told several outright <a>lies,that</a> everyone know were lies.Same ol' same ol.
@LindsayK62589 I <a>hate</a> <e>Obama!</e>
<e>Obama</e> <a>bothers</a> me...please stop talking about how great he is.
No one is voting for <e>Obama</e> because he is <a>black</a> I swear to God y'all are so STUPID
@cedriclabonte Mitt <e>Romney</e> did it (create <a>jobs,</a> balanced <a>budgets</a> and <a>Business</a> turnaround). Obama not.
Poor <e>Obama</e> felt offended.  He is not used to having to answer for the <a>truth!</a> #debates
@SammyRose7 omg <e>she</e> is so obviously <a>biased!</a> It was not fair at all she was consistently helping Obama! I'm so mad
Obama and <e>Romney</e> are both terrible candidates, but Romney is less <a>worse</a>
<e>Obama..</e> sorry but I cant vote for <a>you..</a> unfortunately I'm Canadian
<e>Obama</e> <a>could</a> <a>not</a> <a>defend</a> his indefensible record.  #debates
@markknoller <e>she</e> was too busy <a>interrupting</a> Romney and trying to help Obama to get rolled. She let O have 4 minutes longer that R.
Obama got 4 more mins because he kept cutting him off,# <e>Donna</e> Brazile is so <a>stupid</a>
@spaceghostturrt okay... Sooo that means we should just let <e>Obama</e> keep fuckin us up? Pretty sure he tripled our <a>dept.</a>
People don't even know what <e>Obama</e> doing for us they just saying vote for him cause he <a>black.</a>
Bottom line, <e>Obama's</e> <a>policies</a> have failed for 4 years &, if reelected, there is no reason to expect anything different over the next 4 years
My take on debate: Obama did better than last debate, but not good enough. <e>Romney</e> held his own. Both had hits & misses, but Romney <a>won.</a>
<e>Obama</e> <a>suuucks.</a>
@BeirutToJupiter Yeah I saw that :) the content of what <e>Romney</e> was saying seemed more <a>prepared</a> than Obama. The Pres. prob. had a busier day.
<e>Obama=</e> broken <a>promises.</a> Romney= evidence of promises fulfilled.#reliability #Romney2012
And 4 years later.......... <e>Obama</e> has yet to put on his working boots. How do u <a>lie</a> to get into office and not do anything unsaid u would
@ABC <e>Your</e> too <a>bias</a> for Obama. So it doesn't matter what you request.
#R_E_T_W_E_E_T for Obama .. <a>Favorite</a> for <e>Romney</e> !!!
Iv never really been into politics..but im thinking about voting this year..jus to try and help keep <e>Obama</e> <a>out</a> of office.
@ellencarmichael @mittromney Even more disturbing, seemed like <e>Candy</e> set up every topic to leave last <a>word</a> to Obama
<e>#Obama</e> is desperate to keep his job as Vacationer In Chief. <a>Lies,</a> lies, lies. #RomneyRyan2012 #GOP2012 #Vote

@sarahmcsimmons I'm a Democrat and can't wait to vote for Mitt, I only need a few words. The <e>#Obama</e> years have been a <a>failure-he's</a> FIRED!

<e>"Obama</e> put us in <a>bad</a> positions these four years" and bush put us in bad positions for 8 and you voted for him twice.
What President <e>Obama</e> did on Romney was an <a>"Act</a> <a>of</a> <a>Terror".</a>
<a>Lying</a> is an integral part of <e>Obama's</e> character. He's hopeless. #debate
Well done @MittRomney . <e>Obama</e> flat out <a>lied</a> tonight and the moderator pitched in some out of context statements in Obamas favor. #debates
<e>Obama</e> <a>lowered</a> <a>my</a> <a>IQ</a> tonight
It's really not even that I really like Romney, I just really <e>hate</e> <a>Obama.</a>
But <e>Obama</e> is no different from all the other US presidents as far as <a>policies</a> go,they all about war & lots of injustices.
@danful38 And Obama said failed <a>policy's</a> of Bush, caused the gas to be low.  Well I guess <e>Obama's</e> failed policy's have let it rise, lol

 â€°Ã›ÃThis whole concept of <a>fermium play</a> [â€°Ã›_] is the most radical form of <a>entertainment socialism</a> since <e>Obama</e> got elected." http://t.co/uMydep7I                           
 On Oct 4 @fivethirtyeight gave <e>Obama</e> 84% chance of <a>winning</a>. By Oct 14  dropped to 63%. 320 electoral votes to 284 (needs 270). Now 64.8%/287              
 Dumbest <e>economic</e> Argument Ever: <e>Obama</e> arguing that 2008 low gas prices cratered the <a>economy</a>. http://t.co/dDGRfhe7  @MaxCUA @Team<e>Romney</e>                           
 <e>Obama</e> got this shit                           
 I mean  I support <a>gay marriage</a> but its not the only issue and Obama fixes none of them          
 @RBruceMorgan I don't care how <e>Obama</e> performs on stage  his record is plainly the effects of a <a>failed policy</a> and understanding.              
 ATTN! @TheJuanWilliams  @irritatedwoman @DAVID_MIGHT:Obama told Crowley:Get Rosegarden Transcripts out. How'd he know she had 'em? #Libya

 @CTOompa @BarackObama  You weren't seeing things. <e>Obama</e> is such a prolific liar he believes his own <a>lies</a>.                           
 <e>president</e> <e>Obama</e> alluded to the <a>Fair Pay Act</a> being a statute of limitations change last night.                           
 How anybody can come away from last night's <a>debate</a> & declare <e>Obama</e> as a clear winner...is beyond comprehension.                           
 #questionscrowleydidnotask Pres <e>Obama</e> why does Michelle spend so much <a>taxpayer $$</a> on vacations                           
 @BretBaier <a>Libya</a> will again be the main talking point coming out of this. Crowley's (false) interjection will actually hurt <e>Obama</e> this week.                           
 Worse. RT @RNCResearch: Tom Friedman: Obama's Weakness Is How Will Next <a>Four Years</a> Be Different http://t.co/GrdsTeWV #debates                           
 @michellemalkin @JayCostTWS And <e>Obama</e> ran away from it eager to change the <a>topic</a>!!                           
 Feds increase fuel efficiency stds  Obama Adminâ€°Ã›Âªs own admission increases <a>cost of car</a> by 1 100 Some suggest even more.           
 @CannabisCunt i wouldnt be pleased #wish Gaga could fix it so monsters all round  the world could vote for Obama                           
 "I'm the <e>president</e> and am always <a>responsible</a>"-Obama except for that. That was bush's fault. Oh and that... #confused #deedadee

 Best statement by a focus group member:  <e>Obama</e> "is bullshitting on everything."                           
 <e>Obama</e> should start challenging leaders to dunk contests. Like   "Hey China  double or nothing on the <a>national debt</a>?" Boom. Economy solved."                        
 MT RT @ErikWemple Guy from town hall debate says <e>Obama</e> didn't really answer his question on <a>Libya security</a>: http://t.co/YsJEjVhG  #tcot @p2                           
 Yo look at some of the shit <e>Obama</e> signed into <a>law</a> tho----> http://t.co/sD78zpT8
